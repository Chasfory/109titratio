# 109titratio
Program has to read titrant volume and pH couples from a csv file, and output:  
1.the derivative values for each given volume,  
2.the closest point from the equivalence point amongst those given points,  
3.the second derivative values for each given volume,  
4.an estimate of the second derivative values every 0.1 ml around the above closest point from the equivalence point, using linear interpolation,  
5.the proper equivalence point, estimated from the second derivative in python language
